# Homebridge Denon Marrantz

homebridge-plugin for Denon and Marantz AVR control with Apple-Homekit. Works with most Denon AVR since 2011, supports a second zone and implements the speaker service.

# Why V2?

I add `defaultVolume` and `defaultInput` parameters so when you turn on it's set a default parameter

# Installation
Follow the instruction in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge) for the homebridge server installation. The plugin is published through [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-denon) and should be installed "globally" by typing:

### notes
If you are interested in setting the volume of your receiver with Siri than [this](https://github.com/robertvorthman/homebridge-marantz-volume) plugin might be a good addition. Only remember to not tell Siri "Set the light in the Living room to 100 %" ;)
